# Overview

Udacity FEND project --- Neighborhood Map.

Aim seems mainly to practice proper Javascript programming, separation of concerns (M-V-VM with Knockout), and the use of 3rd party API (Google Maps and Foursquare in my case).

# Getting Started

`npm i` will install the required Node.js packages to build this project.

`grunt dist` will compile `scss/styles.scss` file into `css/styles.css`, and then copy all necessary files into `dist/`.

Then, `cd dist` and `python3 -m http.server` will start a webserver in `dist/`.

Open a browser and enter a URL of `localhost:8000` to see the app in action.
